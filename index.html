    The hardest thing I learned in the class was easily the javascript portion of the class, more specifically, the selector part. I remember one day in class, I could not figure out what to do for the whole lab and needed to stay an extra hour to get help from Badboy Bradshaw. But to teach someone who does not know how to do the selectors in Javascript, it is a lot simpler than you think. For me I had to constantly think of what I had to retrieve for the data and <i>where it was</i>. Where the data is is extremely important to understanding what to do next. Whether it is in an array or under a div or within a paragraph, you have to start from the parent elemnent and work from there. Another thing is to think of what connects the element you are tryin to get to the parent. For example if I have a paragraph within a div that I want to select, you need to type <q>div.p</q> to select it. A program that really helped me understand this as well was the Selector website, sadly, I can't remember the name but it's something like <q> Selector kitchen</q> or something like that. </p>

        The hardest thing I have yet to understand completely in class is also in Javascript. I can easily say that Javascript is significantly more confusing than HTML and CSS. The part that I have been most confused with recently is how to create a list from Javascript using outside data. I understand how to bring the data into the Javascript file using the Promise function but I don't understand how to create a list, maybe it is because i already know how to do it in HTML so doing it in Javascript throws me off. I also don't understand about the correct order that the different functions go to make the list work. That is probably the most confusing part. When working on the previous labs with the A1,A2, et cetera, I ran into the issue of misunderstanding the steps to achieve the goal. Good thing I had a smart partner to help me out. Basically everything in Javascript except for the d3 stuff, I have a lot of trouble with.
